        Applications build with Lynx relies on back-end system functionality provided by Velvet library. It is crucial
        to point your application to proper Velvet instance. Please contact us if you do not have access to any Velvet
        instance that could be used for test purposes. We will arrange it for you. You will get URL address and
        credentials to use during your work.

        Our application will be a Single-page App (SPA). We will do all tasks in pure html, css and javascript. Thus you
        will not need any server environment (.net, jee, php, you name it...). Due to security restrictions of some web
        browsers (request to file:// does not work) we will use basic http server. We will provide you with http server
        implementation based on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.
        There is no problem though if you would like to use Apache or Tomcat instead. They will do just fine.
