        <h3>adding authentication</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
        Lynx authorization is based on Velvet authorization services. Lynx provides convenience objects which
        encapsulate Velvet authentication service. So to enable authentication services you need first to configure
        Velvet in your application and second - use authentication functionality on your pages.
    </p>
    <h2 class="minor">1. Velvet config</h2>
    <p class="minor">
        Applications build with Lynx are base on back-end system functionality provided by Velvet library. It is crucial
        to point your application to proper Velvet instance. Set that in your application configuration object in
        <strong>velvetConfig</strong>
        property as follows:
    </p>

    <dl class="dl-vertical minor">
        <dt>host</dt>
        <dd>provides url on which the velvet instance is exposed; every http request to Velvet will be directed to that
            url
        </dd>
        <dt>apikey</dt>
        <dd>purpose of that value is to authorize client application to use certain velvet instance</dd>
        <dt>productId</dt>
        <dd>it is Carbon Product ID to be used in communication with Velvet; although authentication does not rely on
            Carbon Product setting, CPID is very important for other services provided by Velvet and thus it needs to be
            set just after authentication and before application exposes rest of its functionality;
            <strong>productId</strong>
            value would be used in all requests to Velvet in this tutorial
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <div>
            Please contact us if you do not have access to any Velvet instance that could be used for test purposes. We
            will arrange it for you. You will get URL address and credentials to use during your work.

        </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="minor">2. Authentication Model</h2>
    <p>
        Having Velvet configured, our application is ready to utilize authentication model implemented in Lynx. We will
        use
        <strong>lynx.models.AuthModel</strong>
        object which encapsulate all velvet authentication. You just need to add
        <strong>globals</strong>
        parameter to application configuration as it is shown in following code snippet.
    </p>
    <div class="tabbable higlightable minor">
        <div class="tab-pane active" title="app.js">
            <pre class="linenums onlyHighlight" pp-url="'content/tutorial/step4/snippet/2/app.js'"></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="minor">
        You may choose authentication provider by setting
        <strong>authMode</strong>
        velvet configuration property. If it is missing, BASIC authentication is assumed. Value of that property may be
        set to any exposed as
        <strong>velvet.service.Authenticate</strong>
        constants:
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-vertical minor">
        <dt>AUTH_BASIC</dt>
        <dd>Basic authentication uses username and password as user credentials. It is provided in http Authorization
            header. Username and password are transmitted as Base64 encoded text. This Base64 encoded string is used
            later on as authentication token by your app.
        </dd>
        <dt>AUTH_RC4_TOKEN</dt>
        <dd>This mode of authentication is also based on username / password credentials. On very first authentication
            http request it uses same way of providing credentials as Basic authentication. Backend system generates
            security token based on RC4 encryption algorithm.
        </dd>

            Currently Atlas Ticket authentication is not supported by Velvet platform. There is ongoing work to extend
            Velvet with AT support.

    <h2 class="minor">3. Application changes</h2>
    <p class="minor">
        Now you should use
        <strong>$auth</strong>
        model properties instead of models we used in previous steps.
        We will use three properties in our application:
    </p>

    <dl class="dl-vertical minor">
        <dt>authenticated</dt>
        <dd>determines whether user is authenticated; that property is used in index.html to switch between login page
            ($auth.authenticated == false) or standard application logic
        </dd>
        <dt>pending</dt>
        <dd>determines whether authentication is in progress; property let us properly change UI while login is
            processed (e.g. presenting loading indicator)
        </dd>
        <dt>authenticationFailed</dt>
        <dd>determines whether last authentication failed; it is used on log.html page to show error message if user
            authentication will fail
        </dd>
    </dl>
