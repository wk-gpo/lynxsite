<p>WebStorm/Idea have really nice plugin for live editing of web page with auto refreshing page markup on editing.
    But this plugin do not work well with Angular, especially with <code>ng-includes</code>.
</p>
<p>Lynx provides very similar solution which works well with <code>Sass</code>. There is small class <code>ResourcesUpdater</code> which
    decorates Angular <code>ng-include</code> directive (so you do not have to provide any changes in application),
    and collecting all css links. After page load and after turning on by F9 key <code>ResourcesUpdater</code>
    verifies the last modified date of each include/css (HEAD request).
    If some of them is changed from last time, resource gets reloaded.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <code>ng-include</code> always creates new scope. After refreshing this scope will be cleared.
    So if you have some included popup on some included area on some included page, and in editor you will
    change the popup html snippet, only popup will be refreshed, if you will change the page html snippet,
    whole page be refreshed and popup will be closed (if state of popup visibility was in page scope like
    we do in Cheetah).
</p>
<p>ResourcesUpdater is working only in <code>?debug</code> mode.
