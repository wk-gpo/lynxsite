    <p>This article presents some information regarding implementation of authentication algorithms provided by
        Lynx. It is based on algorithms of Velvet. Read <a href="docs.html#/guide/velvetConfig">Velvet config</a> for
        details how to configure your app to use certain auth algorithym.
    </p>
    <p>Regardless of user authentication mode configured, Lynx provides some utilities for "remember user" and
        "user auto login" functions of web application. It utilizes cookie (auth token is stored in cookie) and
        local storage (authentication data are stored in local storage).
    </p>

    <h3>Basic authentication</h3>
    <p>Basic authentication uses username and password as user credentials. It is provided in http
        <code>Authorization</code> header. Username and password are transmitted as Base64 encoded text (for more details read
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side">wikipedia</a> article).
        This Base64 encoded string is used later on as authentication token by your app.<br/>
        Due to that fact it's the least secure method of authorization - Base64 encoded string is not only transmitted
        via net but also is stored in client's environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although Velvet provides <code>identity-v1</code> service for authentication purposes there is no dedicated
        method exposed for Basic authentication. Method <code>Ping</code> is used - it is method available in each Velvet
        service devised in first place for keep-alive periodic requests.
    </p>
    <p>To set up Basic authentication use <a href="docs.html#/api/wk.lynx.velvet/velvet.service.Auth#AUTH_BASIC">AUTH_BASIC</a>
        switch.
    </p>
    <h3>RC4 Token authentication</h3>
    <p>This mode of authentication is also based on username / password credentials. On very first authentication http
        request it uses same way of providing credentials as Basic authentication. Backend system generates security token which
        is provided back to user. The token is created based on RC4 encryption algorithm.<br/>
        That value is later on used as token by any future http request and more over that is token
        which get stored in user local environment. So, RC4 Token authentication is more secure then Basic authentication.
    </p>
    <p>Velvet provided special method for that type of authenitcation <code>identity-v1/AccessToken?type='Twill-RC4-Token'</code>.
    </p>
    <p>To set up RC4 Token authentication use
        <a href="docs.html#/api/wk.lynx.velvet/velvet.service.Auth#AUTH_RC4_TOKEN">AUTH_RC4_TOKEN</a> switch.
    </p>

    <h3>IP / URL Referral authentication (anonymous authentication)</h3>
    <p><b>TODO: this auth method is not already implemented</b></p>
    <p>Some organizations would like to provide some predefined user credentials for authentication purposes based on
        user agent location. For that purpose IP and/or URL Referral are used. Authentication service uses data provided
        in http headers to select referenced user account. Authentication logic on server site uses that user account
        for authentication and for that account creates session token which is returned to user agent.
    </p>

    <h3>Proxy authentication</h3>
    <p><b>TODO: this auth method is not already implemented</b></p>
    <p>This authentication method may be considered as special type of anonymous authentication. It does not require user
        to provide any credentials. Instead, one predefined user account is used.
        The method may be used to provide access for some publicly available content or in closed environment where
        users may access your web app only from workstations which assures user identification by other means.

    </p>

    <h3>External Login Page</h3>
    <p><b>TODO: this auth method is not already implemented</b></p>
    <p>Some organizations provides one centralized authentication mechanism. It is implemented with redirection to
        certain external login page which is responsible for user authentication. In case of positive processing user
        is redirected back to source web application. That redirection URL is extended with Atlas Ticket created for
        user.<br/>
        Atlas Ticket is provided to your web application authentication service. It is used as authentication token
        in any future requests of your application.
