    <p>
        End-to-End Testing is a methodology used to assure that application flow works as designed top to the bottom.
        It allows to recognize any system dependencies which make problems while application is run in form of final assembly.<br/>
        Applying E2E to web application testing one have to test application using it's UI as presented via web browser.
        Lynx project environment provides solutions for e2e testing automation. Using that techniques you will be able
        to run your E2E test within context of your CI infrastructure.
    </p>
    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <h4><a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a></h4>
    <p>Node is used as JavaScript run environment in project. Other tools
        used in development are written in JavaScript (are actually a JavaScripts files). Node enables launching them in
        development environment.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="http://karma-runner.github.io" target="_blank">Karma</a></h4>
    <p>In Lynx environment Karma is used as test runner.
        Although you may choose other tool for that purpose, Lynx project as well as examples presented here are base
        on Karma.
    </p>


    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>Karma needs to be learnt some about your project. It's done through Karma
        <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/config/configuration-file.html">configuration file</a> settings.
        You will prepare that configuration file within your project. As a good practice it is usually created
        in folder <code>test</code> under root folder of your project.
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
            project_root/
               test/                --> here goes all test files
                   test-e2e.conf.js --> this is Karma config file
        </pre>
        Read Karma documentation regarding <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/config/configuration-file.html">config file</a>
        if you need more details on that topic. As we found useful for Lynx based project at least following
        options should be configured:
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/config/files.html"><code>files</code></a> allows to provide to
            Karma list of files used in test run (read more in subparagraph)</li>
        <li><code>baseDir</code> allows to set base folder for files paths resolution; it is related to <code>files</code>
            parameter
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/config/browsers.html"><code>browsers</code></a> defines browsers
            from local environments to be used for E2E tests
        </li>
        <li><code>autoWatch</code> flag to enable Karma to listen on files changes to rerun test; set to <code>true</code></li>
        <li><code>singleRun</code> flag to enable CI mode of testing; if set to <code>true</code> Karma process will
            be stopped after execution of all tests; set to <code>false</code></li>
        <li><code>reporters</code> usually set in our project to <code>['dots', 'junit']</code>
        </li>
        <li><code>junitReporter</code> additional configuration for <code>junit</code> reporter (see parameter
            <code>reporters</code>)
        </li>
        <li><code>proxies</code> it defines proxy paths to be used for requests issued to Karma to web server</li>
        <li><code>port</code> is port number of web server run by Karma; we choose <code>8085</code>; it must be
            different port web application under tests is exposed on
        </li>
        <!--<li><code>runnerPort</code></li>-->
        </ul>
        <h4><code>files</code> & <code>basePath</code></h4>
        <p>This parameter allows to provide to Karma list of files used in test run. It should at least define following files:
            <ul>
            <li><a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing">Angular Scenario Runner</a> Karma includes
                Angular Scenario Runner as one of predefined runners. Lynx based project should use that runner as Lynx
                itself is built on top of Angular JS.
            </li>
            <li><code>scenario.js</code> which includes some extensions to Angular Scenario Runner which are useful
                in Lynx based application. You can find that file in Lynx package in <code>test/e2e</code> (<b>TODO:
                    it's not currently included in Lynx package</b>)
            </li>
            <li>Page Object Pattern file which reflects your application page components. Read more about POP later in
                that article.
            </li>
            <li>e2e test files - introduction to the structure of those files is pretty well described in
                <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing">Angular Scenario Runner</a> web page.
                Extensions defined in <code>scenario.js</code> file are described later in this article.
            </li>
            </ul>
            We found it useful to set up following structure of test folder:
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
                    project_root/
                       test/                   --> here goes all test files
                          test-e2e.conf.js     --> this is Karma config file
                          scenario.js          --> Lynx extension for Angular Scenario Runner
                          e2e/                 --> all e2e test files
                             pop/              --> Page Object Pattern implementation
                             scenarios/        --> e2e tests
                             report/           --> reports from test execution
                </pre>
            File <code>scenario.js</code> as being a part of Lynx library, may be included in your project as
            part of Lynx and not be copied into test folder.<br/>
            Having test folder structure as presented above configuration of files for Karma would be defined as
            follows:
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
                basePath = '.';    //set paths be relative to folder of test-e2e.conf.js
                files = [
                    ANGULAR_SCENARIO,          //Angular Scenario Runner - constant define in Karma
                    ANGULAR_SCENARIO_ADAPTER,  //Angular Scenario Runner - constant define in Karma
                    'scenario.js',             //Lynx extension to Angular Scenario Runner
                    'e2e/pop/**/*.js',         //Page Object Pattern implementation
                    'e2e/scenarios/**/*.js'    //E2E tests
                ];
                </pre>
        </p>

    <h4><code>browsers</code></h4>
    <p> You provide here browser names which are defined in Karma and mapped to local path for browser executable.
        Read Karma <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/config/browsers.html">documentation</a> on available
        values for that option.
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        browsers = ['Chrome'];
        </pre>
        If you will provide more than one browser name, Karma runner will initiate test on all of chosen
        browsers.
        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
            There is known bug in Karma for Chrome on Window environments (see Karma/lib/launchers/Chrome.js).
            Currently launch command for win32 is defined as follows:<br/>
            <code>win32: process.env.LOCALAPPDATA + '\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe'</code><br/>
            so itâ€™s based on <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%</code> folder instead of <code>%PROGRAMFILES%</code>
            environment variable.<br/>
            As a workaround just define OS environment variable CHROME_BIN pointing to installation folder of Chrome
            usually <code>C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe</code>.
        </div>
    </p>
    <h4><code>autoWatch</code> & <code>singleRun</code></h4>
    <p>We found it convenient to set Karma to watch every files changes done by developer. If any watched file is changes
        Karma will rerun test. To make it work you need to keep Karma alive (thus <code>singleRun=false</code>) and to
        make Karma to listen on any file change (<code>autoWatch=true</code>).
    </p>

    <h4><code>reporters</code> & <code>junitReporter</code></h4>
    <p>Reporters are writing information after each test is run. For e2e test we usually test two reportes:
        <ul>
        <li><code>dots</code> causes output to console of '.' sign per each test run</li>
        <li><code>junit</code> which makes additionally some data to be written to report files; that requires
            <code>junitReporter</code> to be defined</li>
        </ul>
        Parameter <code>junitReporter</code> configures that reporter. Set it as follows:
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        junitReporter = {
            outputFile:'report/e2e.xml',
            suite:'e2e'
        };
        </pre>
        to make report file to subfolder <code>e2e</code> of <code>basePath</code>. Notice that <code>outputFile</code>
        is defined as relative path. That particular configuration will make test report to be written here:
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        project_root/
           test/
              e2e/          --> set in junitReporter.suite
                 report/    --> set in junitReporter.outputFile
                    e2e.xml --> set in junitReporter.outputFile
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h4><code>proxies</code></h4>
    <p>Karma runs its own webserver. All tests are actually performed by issuing http requests to Karma's web server.
        To make them access other resources (e.g. tested web application) you need to define it as a proxy.
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        proxies = {
            '/':'http://localhost/testedApp/'
        };
        </pre>
        This configuration would cause every call to Karma's root path to point to location where tested
        application is available (here <code>localhost</code> and standard port 80).
    </p>


    <!--<h3>Lynx <code>scenario.js</code> extentions</h3>-->
    <h3>Page Object Pattern</h3>
    <p>Page Object Pattern (POP) represents application pages as set of objects each of them encapsulating
        related page functionality and data. Read more about overall idea of PageObject
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>We decided to use POP due to following reasons
        <ul>
        <li>reduction of code duplication<br/>
            All implementation details directly related to page data&functions are aggregated in one POP object. Tests
            does not need to know any technical details regarding page structure. Every time a change is introduced to
            page it needs only related POP object to be adjusted - test code could be not affected.
        </li>
        <li>test readability improvement<br/>
            Since test are implemented based on POP object functionality only important information is visible in
            test implementation  e.g. test defines certain field should be set with certain data but does not exposes
            technical details on how it should be done. The latter is wrapped by POP object.
        </li>
        <li>it improves test maintainability<br/>
            Change to web application page does not directly affects tests but only one POP object related to that page.
            For huge test set it's crucial not to get stuck updating thousands of test even on relatively simple
            modification of you web application which is css selector change.
        </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>E2E test </h3>
    <p>Please <a href="download/StarterAppTestSuite.zip">download</a> example project we prepared for StarterApp where
        you will find e2e test configuration, POP implementation as well as couple of e2e scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>StarterApp itself can be found <a href="download/StarterApp.zip">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>How to run test suite</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Deploy StarterApp on server of your choosing, note url under which it's available.</li>

        <li>Unpack StarterAppTestSuite.zip, this will create directory StarterAppTestSuite.</li>

        <li>Go to StarterAppTestSuite/test and edit runTest.sh or runTest.cmd for Windows users and change node executable
            to one appropriate for your system:<br>
            node-linux-32 node-linux-64 for Linux 32bit and 64bit<br>
            node-win-32 node-win-64 for Windows 32bit and 64bit<br>
            node-darwin-32 node-darwin-64 for MacOS X 32bit and 64bit<br>

            Linux and Mac users need to set executable permission for file they are using, eg:<br>

            chmod a+x ../Tools/NodeJs/node-linux-64
        </li>
        <li>Open file starterAppE2E.conf.js and in object proxies change
            'http://localhost:8000/Base/Apps/LynxSite/LynxSiteWeb/resources/StarterApp/' to url under which StarterApp
            is available on your system. If you have Firefox instead of Chrome, you should also modify Browsers object.
        </li>
        <li>Run "runTest" script, the browser will start and output on terminal should look like this
        <pre class="prettyprint">
            INFO [karma]: Karma server started at http://localhost:8051/__testacular/
            INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome
