<p>Lynx base application is generally speaking a single page app. Although you may use different pages if you
    need, default way of navigation is based on certain html file which is able to switch its content
    based on user actions.<br/>
    What is important in such kind of applications is to manage page URLs to let distinguish between different page
    content event though it is presented via the same html page. It is important both for:
    <ul>
    <li>user as he/she would be able to bookmark certain application page or see human readable browser history and</li>
    <li>web app programmer since that makes it easier to open proper page view on user request or to initialize
        page navigation
    </li>
    </ul>
    Lynx provides solution to all of above mentioned purposes.
</p>

<h3>URL structure</h3>
<p>Lynx uses hash bang URL notation for that purpose. It means that application extends URL with certain anchor-like
    string with a structure usually providing clues on what view should be presented to user.
    Have a look on following example:
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    http://svr.wk.com/index.html#/home
    </pre>
    It loads <code>index.html</code> which has logic of switching page snippets. As snippet to present it would use
    that one mapped to <code>/home</code> path.<br/>
    See next example
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    http://svr.wk.com/index.html#/result/id/1213321231/pageNo/1/pageSize/30
                     __________/            _____________________________/
                      html page              anchor defining page snippet
    </pre>
    In this situation snippet path includes not only definition of view (it's <code>/result</code>) but also some
    information regarding content:
    <ul>
        <li><code>/id/1213321231</code> - show results of search which id="1213321231"</li>
        <li><code>/pageNo/1</code> - show first page of results (do not load all result records)</li>
        <li><code>/pageSize/30</code> - show 30 results per page</li>
    </ul>
    You may use any other URL schema most suitable for your needs. Also you may easily map between URL and model values.
    All you need is to design proper URL structure and then provide it's as your lynx module parametrization.
</p>

<h3>Lynx module parameters</h3>
<p>As you may already found, Lynx base application is initialized with configuration map of following structure:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-01"></pre>
<script type="text/ng-template" id="app.js-01">
    (function (global) {
    ...
    var loginExample = lynx.module({
        moduleName: ...,
        globals: ...,
        pages: ...,
        defaultPath: ...
    });
</script>
<p>Page navigation is defined in <code>pages</code> array which we will familiarize with in following paragraphs.
   Discussion on other configuration elements may be found in <a href="docs.html#/guide/lynxConfiguration">Lynx
   Module Configuration</a> document.
</p>
<p>To use page navigation in your app you should include following element in proper html page:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="index.html"></pre>
<script type="text/ng-template" id="index.html">
<div ng-include="page.view"></div>
</script>
It is base on angular's <code>ng-include</code> directive and model <code>page.view</code> provided by Lynx based
application. Page that include that element would be base page of application e.g. that page would be present in all
application URLs.
</p>


<p>So, let's have a look on the main elements of <code>pages</code> configuration.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-02"></pre>
<script type="text/ng-template" id="app.js-02">
    pages:[
    {   name: "homePage",
        path: "/home",
        view: "html/page/home.html"
    },
    {   name: "resultsPage",
        path: "/results/id/{$search.getSearch().Id}/pageNo/{$search.getSearch().getParams().pageNo}/pageSize/{$search.getSearch().getParams().perPage}",
        view: "html/page/results.html",
        ...
    },
    ...
    ]
</script>
<p>Every page definition has at least three parameters <code>name</code>, <code>path</code> and <code>view</code> which
    purpose is as follows:
    <ul>
    <li><code>name</code> defines internally used page name; it will not appear on URLs</li>
    <li><code>path</code> defines structure of anchor which would be used in URL for certain page snippet after page loads</li>
    <li><code>view</code> defines relative path from web app root folder to file containing page snippet html</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>As you can see <code>homePage</code> has got only those three main params. It defines that for following URL
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
http://svr.wk.com/index.html#/home
</pre>
code snippet from <code>&lt;WEB_APP_ROOT&gt;/html/page/home.html</code> will be loaded by lynx app. If user enters
into browser address field that url your application will load proper snippet. You can use the same URL in you app e.g.
in &lt;a&gt; elements which should switch application view to home page.
</p>



<h3>URL to data binding</h3>
<p>More interesting is example for <code>resultsPage</code>.
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-03"></pre>
    <script type="text/ng-template" id="app.js-03">
    path: "/results/id/{$search.getSearch().Id}/pageNo/{$search.getSearch().getParams().pageNo}/pageSize/{$search.getSearch().getParams().perPage}"
    </script>
    As you may noticed, the <code>path</code> configuration
    includes angular expressions which binds fragment of URL to models. You can use binding to any model you need.
    The example above is based on Lynx provided <code><a href="docs.html#/api/wk.lynx.core/lynx.models.SearchModel">SearchModel</a></code>
    which is by convention mapped to <code>$search</code> variable in
    your application <code>$rootScope</code>. <br/>
    Such definition will automatically provide parameters from URL to model your application uses e.g. following
    URL typed in by user:
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-04"></pre>
    <script type="text/ng-template" id="app.js-04">
    http://svr.wk.com/index.html#/results/id/a3-7cb0-4687-808b/pageNo/2/pageSize/50
    </script>
    will map following values to your model:
    <ul>
        <li><code>$search.getSearch().Id = a3-7cb0-4687-808b</code></li>
        <li><code>$search.getSearch().getParams().pageNo = 2</code></li>
        <li><code>$search.getSearch().getParams().perPage = 50</code></li>
    </ul>
    which could be used by your application to present second page of search with certain id. View would include 50
    result elements on it. If you would like to go further and understand how to do implement such functionality
    please go to <a href="docs.html#/guide/search">Search</a> document. For purpose of this elaboration it is
    important to learn that such binding is available and could be used to provide parameters to your app.
</p>
<p>Data binding between URL and model works also in opposite direction. If your app will switch to certain page
    and your model will have all parameters used in <code>path</code> defined for that page, Lynx will automatically
    update URL presented by browser with properly resolved binding expressions. That means that if you will initiate
    search on your model with following parameters:
    <ul>
        <li><code>$search.getSearch().getParams().pageNo = 1</code></li>
        <li><code>$search.getSearch().getParams().perPage = 30</code></li>
    </ul>
    and search operation will return results with <code>$search.getSearch().Id</code> set to e.g. <code>ere-343</code>
    Lynx will update URL in browser to:
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-05"></pre>
    <script type="text/ng-template" id="app.js-05">
        http://svr.wk.com/index.html#/results/id/ere-343/pageNo/1/pageSize/30
    </script>
    You do not need to any actions to make that URL update happen. It's a Lynx feature ready to use.<br/>
    If you would like to see example code go to <a href="docs.html#/guide/search">Search</a> document and code examples
    provided there.
</p>
<p>One important information regarding binding from model to URL. Lynx process of switching between pages works
    in following steps:
    <ul>
    <li>first Lynx switches page content (loads file defined by <code>view</code> element) which initiates any logic
        provided there
    </li>
    <li>when all model values used by <code>path</code> elements are available it updated URL in browser
    </li>
    </ul>
    It works that way since binded models usually stores information which is provided by back end systems (e.g.
    search id). Until communication with back end system is not finalized the URL would include some unbound models.
    If such incomplete URL is set in browser, it would get to browser history braking possible further navigation.<br/>
    That is helpful but has got some side effect you need to be aware of. If by any reason at least one of
    models used in path binding stays undefined, Lynx will not update URL of page at all even though actual processing
    would finish. So, if you will experience that your app does not updated URLs, have a look if all models used
    in bindings got updated properly.
</p>

<h3>Events assignment</h3>
<p>Lynx let's to assign certain event which appear during application processing to page views. Let's assume that
    in certain processing point application calls following instruction:
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    $search.trigger('searchById');
    </pre>
    Lynx provides you with ready solution to easily bind page to any event. It would initiate switch to certain
    page with no need of coding. What you need it just to provide <code>eventBinding</code> section in
    <code>pages</code> Lynx app configuration parameter.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-06"></pre>
<script type="text/ng-template" id="app.js-06">
    pages:[
    ...
    {   name: "resultsPage",
        path: ...,
        view: ...,
        eventBinding: [
            {model: "$search", event: "searchById"},
            {model: "$search", event: "searchByPhrase"}
        ],
    ...
    ]
</script>
<p>In above snippet of lynx configuration two events on <code>$search</code> model has been bound to <code>resultsPage</code>.
    If any part of you app will call <code>$search.trigger('searchByPhrase')</code> Lynx will automatically
    switch page to <code>resultsPage</code>. No coding needed.
</p>


<h3>URL schemas initiate page</h3>
<p>Functionality presented up until now allows to define URL schema which are used e.g. to map between
    URL typed by user and application page. Lynx provides additional functionality to add more flexibility to that use
    case. Let's go back for a moment to path schema defined for <code>resultsPage</code>.
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-03"></pre>
    It's quite complex. User may use it as browser bookmark but it would be quite inconvenient for user to type it
    in. You may find it useful to let your application switch to certain page even if user uses a little bit shorter URL.
    Have a look on following configuration snippet.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-07"></pre>
<script type="text/ng-template" id="app.js-07">
    pages:[
    ...
    {   name: "resultsPage",
        path: ...,
        view: ...,
        eventBinding: [...],
        routes: [
        {   path: "/results"
        },
        {   path: "/results/{query}",
            methods: [
                {model: "$search",
                method: "searchByPhrase",
                params: ["{query}"] }
            ]
        },
        {   path: "/results/id/{searchId}",
            methods: [
                {model: "$search",
                method: "searchById",
                params: ["{searchId}"]}
            ]
        },
        {   path: "/results/id/{searchId}/pageNo/{pageNo}/pageSize/{pageSize}",
            methods: [
                {model: "$search",
                method: "searchById",
                params: ["{searchId}", "{pageNo}", "{pageSize}"]}
            ]
        }
        ],
        ...
    },
    ...
    ]
</script>
<p>You may see there <code>routes</code> configuration array. It defines URL schemas that could be used for
    certain page. User may now use any of URL structures definded in <code>path</code> elements within <code>routes</code>
    array.<br/>
    Keep in mind that if <code>routes</code> array is present in page configuration, default
    route for <code>path</code> value will be overwritten. Only <code>path</code> elements from <code>route</code>
    array will be accepted by your application. Thus one of <code>path</code> schemas provided in <code>routes</code>
    array must be fully compatible with URL structure provided in main  <code>path</code> element in page definition.
    In example above the last member of <code>route</code> array fulfills that requirement.
</p>
<p>Each page definition may include information on actions that should be undertaken on page request. It is defined
    in <code>methods</code> array.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="app.js-08"></pre>
<script type="text/ng-template" id="app.js-08">
        {   path: "/results/{query}",
            methods: [
                {model: "$search", method: "searchByPhrase", params: ["{query}"]}
            ]
        }
</script>
As you see on above example, for given URL schema function <code>searchByPhrase</code> would be called on
<code>$search</code> and url part bind by <code>query</code> model would be provided as parameter.<br/>
You should not to use here your model variables. The variables defined in angular expressions in here are
used only to bind URL section to model function call as parameters.
