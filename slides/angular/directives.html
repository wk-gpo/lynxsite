        angularJS - directives
    </h1>
    <div class="desc">
        Directives are a way to teach HTML new tricks. During DOM compilation directives are matched against the HTML
        and executed. This allows directives to register behavior, or transform the DOM. For creating the reusable
        UI components Lynx is using Directives. Directives covers:
        <ul>
            <li>generic simple  UI controls (tree, popup, …)</li>
            <li>functional UI components (login form, search form, search results, …)</li>
            <li>UI layout components (split panel, …)</li>
            <li>custom events handlers (click, keypress,...)</li>
            <li>logical elements (if, switch, loops ....)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>easy asynchronous</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Developers don’t have to care about asynchronous actions, do not need to use callbacks, synchronization, etc...
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>readable</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Simple, readable and natural syntax of binding expressions based on referenced API.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>flexible</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Flexible and open model, without any inheritance/wrappers/etc requirements.
                Models are JavaScript objects, arrays, primitives, it doesn’t matter. Angular Js provides also
                easy data conversion mechanism by filters.

        <li>
            <h2>isolation</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                There is no direct DOM manipulation and no DOM referencing from logic.
                Perfect isolation of Model and View Layer. This dramaticaly siplyfing testing.
