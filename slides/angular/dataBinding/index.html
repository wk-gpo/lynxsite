        angularJS - data binding
    </h1>
    <div class="desc">
        AngularJS' two-way data binding is its most notable feature which substantially reduces the amount of code written by
        relieving the server back-end from templating responsibilities. Instead, templates are rendered in plain HTML
        according to data contained in a scope defined in the model. The $scope service in Angular detects changes
        to the model section and modifies HTML expressions in the view via defined controller. Likewise, any alterations to
        the view are reflected in the model. This circumvents the need to actively manipulate the DOM and encourages
        bootstrapping and rapid prototyping of web applications.

            <h2>readable</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Simple, readable and natural syntax of binding expressions based on referenced API.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>flexible</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Flexible and open model without any inheritance/wrappers/etc requirements.
                Models are JavaScript objects, arrays, primitives, it doesn’t matter. Angular Js provides also
                easy data conversion mechanism by filters.

        <li>
            <h2>data driven</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                There is no need of any DOM event handling in your code. All you need to do is observing&amp;binding the data.

            <h2>easy asynchronous</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Developers don’t have to care about asynchronous actions, do not need to use callbacks, synchronization, etc...
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>isolation</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                There is no direct DOM manipulation and no DOM referencing from logic.
                Perfect isolation of Model and View Layer. This dramatically simplifies testing.
