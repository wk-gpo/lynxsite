        AngularJS is a structural framework maintained by Google for dynamic web applications.
        It lets you use HTML as your template language and at the same time extend HTML's syntax to express 
		your application's components clearly and succinctly. 
		Out of the box, it eliminates much of the code you currently must to write through data
        binding and dependency injection. And it all is accomplished in JavaScript within the browser,
        making it an ideal partner with any server technology.
