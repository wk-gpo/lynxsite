    <div class="desc">
        OSA (On-line Service Architecture) is a GPO asset consisting of standard API contracts and development frameworks
        for Java and .NET to build applications that use these API contracts. The development framework simplifies the
        programming model and adds common functionality like validation, monitoring &amp; policy (‘Watchdog’), version
        transformation and diagnostics.

                OSA is designed to work in trusted and high speed networks and not intended to be exposed to the open Internet.
                As side effect developers have to develop OSA wrapper services for every application that needs to be
                connected with OSA provider though the Internet.

                Services are defined in domains – research, identity, user management, case management, etc. One of those
                domains is Research (the Global Atlas domain). The implementation of an OSA-compliant service on Global
                Atlas is the Atlas RSI (Research Service Interface).
