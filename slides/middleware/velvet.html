            <div class="pointCommentary">
                The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to
                unlock your data and free it from silos that exist in applications today. OData does this by applying and
                building upon Web technologies such as HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (Atom Pub) and JSON to provide
                access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores. The protocol emerged from
                experiences implementing Atom Pub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several
                years.
