            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Services are providing data as a promises/future objects.
                You may - but you are not forced to - use callbacks.
                If promises are binded to UI template, application automatically repaint the UI of promise resolving.

            <h2>clear api</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Services are created to cover javascript parameters transformation to raw http request.
                You do not have to know the Velvet to use it. All services are "statically" typed and well documented.

            <h2>testable</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Services are covered by the unit and system tests.
                During the framework development all changes and incompatibilities
                with middleware are quickly detected and could be easily resolved.
                This provides stability and simplifies integration.

            <h2>separation</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Developers can use services layer without any other Lynx code.
                The services layer can be used separately in any AngularJs application
                without need of use any other Lynx layer.

            <h2>cross-domain</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Services supports full cross-domain communication and that includes IE7/8/9.
                The only restriction is that Velvet instance should be exposed on subdomain.
