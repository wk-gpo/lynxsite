        lynx framework - models
    </h1>

    <div class="desc">
        Lynx provides layer of reusable and statefull models designed to keep state of the application.
        Models encapsulate the service calls and hide synchronization code required.

            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Models keep the application state.
                If some data have to be reused this data have to be stored in model to limit the services calls number.

            <h2>global</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Models are globally available. You can bind your expressions to model's actions from any template.
                Models instances are created declaratively and it is possible to create many instances of the same model.

            <h2>self control</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Models care about integration of any actions. If some action require multiple services call
                model will do this by itself and will take care of data integrity.

            <h2>testable</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Models are covered by unit tests.
                Models are independent from UI what make testing very easy.

            <h2>integration</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                There is possibility for cross models communication. Models may trigger events. By handling those event it is possible to 
				perform some additional actions.
