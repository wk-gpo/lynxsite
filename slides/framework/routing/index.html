    <div class="desc">
        The one of the key problem with the <abbr title='Single Page Application'>SPA</abbr> is how to keep, save and

                By simple declaration application will be able to automatically populate data from
                model to URL. The same declaration is used for model updates with values provided as parts of page URL.

            <h2>action triggering</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                By simple declaration matched routing can trigger action, for example call method on model. That
				keeps separation of code both in Lynx framework but also in your application

            <h2>independent</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Routing is declarative and independent from other application development code. Can be added
                or modified on any development step.
