			WK strategy of User Centric development requires supporting UX teams in their prototyping 
			and UX creation work
                    </li>
                    <li>
			UX teams have been asking for ability to work freely with expanding array of CSS/JS/HTML 
			frameworks and libraries – their work is about creation of best of the breed UX concepts, 
			using open, 3rd party tools and solutions
                    </li>
                    <li>
			Their work should be easily integrated / translated into application implementation
                    </li>
                    <li>
			It is not just a one time, start of development event. UX changes happen during development cycle 
			– even more often on User Centric, iterative projects - due to customer feedback, live testing 
			of early implementations, change of business rules

            <div class="pointCommentary">
                <ul>
                    <li>
			There must be a continuum of UX concept-to-product process, 
			integrated with the development process
                    </li>
                    <li>
			Both teams (design and development) should be able to work 
			on the same code base from early stages through production delivery of an application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
			Typically when UX team creates a new prototype, it is all "smoke and mirror" type of 
			application, using combination of some mock data and static pages
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From UI design, through static prototype to production application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From real data prototype to production application
                    </li>
                </ul>
                We promote both kinds of processes. Lynx have to simplify and help application development
                process from early stages to deployment on production environment.

            <div class="pointCommentary">
                WK ecosystem distinguish two types of applications:
                <ul>
                    <li>
			Assembled apps which are build from set of predefined components. Could be very 
			quickly provided but are restricted to currently implemented functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
			More complex, more effort-expensive “high-end” applications. Once as template is
			complete then can be adopted widely by other businesses using configuration/parametrization
			tools to create new products.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                In both cases we want to simplify and accelerate the process of application creation.

            <h2>easy and high reusability</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>
			A vision of highly reusable modules and UI components usually creates a tension with 
			new UX product concepts development. Highly fine-tuned UX concepts quite often require 
			extensions or modifications to existing components and/or creation of custom, app specific variants
                    </li>
                    <li>
			Lynx provides techniques and patterns for creating highly reusable code, within the project,
	                business and organization boundaries. The way of increasing of reusability of components have to be 
			as simple as possible, without limitations of usability.

			project members since all may refer to same asset - a working application</li>
                    <li>embrace change - focus on current requirements prevents waist of time</li>
                    <li>inspect and adapt - present current state of solution to the appropriate 
			stakeholders and get the fast feedback they need to steer a proper course.</li>
