            <h2>easy implementation & configuration of new application regardless of the scale</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                In WK ecosystem we single out two types of applications:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                Applications from a single set of components i.e. quick assembly of new app from what’s
                already available.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                And more complex, more expensive “high-end” new applications, which, once a template is
                complete then can be adopted widely by other businesses using configuration/parametrization
                tools to create new products.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                In both of cases we want to simplify and accelerate the process of application ceation.

            <h2>end to end proccess support</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                We also sngle out two types of application creation proccess:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        From UI design, by static prototype to production application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From real data prototype to production application
                    </li>
                </ul>
                We promote both kinds of proccess. Lynx have to simplify and helps the application creation
                proccess from early begining to production deployment.

                Lynx have to provide the technics and paterns for creating high reusable code, within the project,
                bussiness and organization. The way of incresing of reusability of components have to be as simple as posible,
                without providing and limitations of usability.
