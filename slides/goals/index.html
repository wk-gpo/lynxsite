            <h2>easy implementation &amp; configuration of new application regardless of the scale</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                WK ecosystem distinguish two types of applications:
                <ul>
                    <li>
					Assembled apps which are build from set of predefined components. Could be very 
					quickly provided but are restricted to currently implemented functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
					More complex, more effort-expensive “high-end” applications. Once as template is
					complete then can be adopted widely by other businesses using configuration/parametrization
					tools to create new products.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                In both cases we want to simplify and accelerate the process of application creation.

            <h2>end to end process support</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                We also distinguish two types of application development processes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        From UI design, through static prototype to production application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From real data prototype to production application
                    </li>
                </ul>
                We promote both kinds of processes. Lynx have to simplify and help application development
                process from early stages to deployment on production environment.

            <h2>easy and high reusability</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Lynx provides techniques and patterns for creating highly reusable code, within the project,
                business and organization boundaries. The way of increasing of reusability of components have to be 
				as simple as possible, without any limitations of usability.

                Especially in the aspect of:
                <ul>
                    <li>early and continuous/frequent delivery - enables better communication between 
						project members since all may refer to same asset - a working application</li>
                    <li>embrace change - focus on current requirements only prevents waist of time</li>
                    <li>inspect and adapt - present current state of solution to the appropriate 
						stakeholders and get the fast feedback they need to steer a proper course.</li>
                </ul>

                We want to provide solution which helps the developer's teams to create high quality products which will be simple
                to maintain and opened for change requests and improvements.
