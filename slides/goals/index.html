            <div class="pointCommentary">
                We want Lynx to embrace WK strategy of User Centric development. It  requires focusing on understanding
                and supporting UX teams in their prototyping and UX creation work. <br/>
                UX teams have been asking for ability to work freely with expanding array of CSS/JS/HTML frameworks 
                and libraries – their work is about creation of best of the breed UX concepts, using open, 3rd party 
                tools and solutions. Their work should be easily integrated / translated into application implementation.

			It is not just a one time, start of development event. UX changes happen during development cycle 
			– even more often on User Centric, iterative projects - due to customer feedback, live testing 
			of early implementations, change of business rules

            <div class="pointCommentary">
				There must be a continuum of UX concept-to-product process, integrated with the development process - 
				it is not just a one time, start of development event. UX changes happen throughout the development 
				cycle – even more often on user centric, iterative projects - due to customer feedback, live testing 
				of early implementations, change of business rules.<br/>
				We want Lynx to allow both teams (design and development) to be able to work on the same code base 
				from early stages through production delivery of an application.<br/>
				Typically when UX team creates a new prototype, it is all "smoke and mirror" type of application, 
				using combination of some mock data and static pages. We want Lynx to allow different approach, 
				supporting easy wiring of these prototypes with live data.

            <h2>create easy reusability patterns</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
				Typical vision of highly reusable, assembly-like UI blocks and components usually creates a tension 
				with new UX product concepts development. Highly fine-tuned UX concepts quite often require extensions 
				or modifications to existing components and/or creation of custom, app specific variants. <br/>
				We want Lynx to provide reusability at several levels, not just UI widgets - Lynx models and controllers, 
				custom filters and directives, customized HTML templates.<br/>
				We want to offer approach of "use as much or as little as you want“ - development teams should be able 
				to reuse higher level Lynx UI components or implement their custom HTML views and bind it with 
				Lynx / OSA 2.0 models

            <div class="pointCommentary">
				Adoption of AngularJS increases team velocity - It’s been widely acknowledged in as one of key benefits 
				of moving different projects to AngularJS. Coding in AngularJS can make app size significantly smaller 
				than comparable code in other frameworks.

            <h2>support quality &amp; maintenance</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
				We want to provide solution which helps developers teams to create high quality products which will be 
				simple to maintain and opened for change requests and improvements. AngularJS provides excellent 
				testing support – it is deeply integrated into Angular’s apps development cycle.

            <div class="pointCommentary">
				We don't want Lynx to be a all-or-nothing proposition, forcing development teams to give up their 
				preferred tools, processes, emerging front-end frameworks. UX teams have been asking for ability 
				to work freely with expanding array of CSS/JS/HTML frameworks and libraries – their work is about

            <h2>create development community</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
				We want to create and foster growth of developers community around Lynx. <br/>
				WK businesses with their own strong development organizations have been resistant to adopting strategy 
				of all-or-nothing migration to GPO ecosystem because of the centralized platform development process. <br/> 
				We want Lynx to allow non-commitment engagement with such businesses, supporting “take it and use it” 
				approach for UX development – similar to OSA adoption strategy. <br/> 
				We want to create LynxSite - a one-stop place to share experience, expectations, knowledge about Lynx 
				projects and development. It should offer - Lynx API references, Guides and Tutorials, Examples – ability to run live code, 
				Project templates, Release artifacts downloads, Blog, Forums / commenting on pages, Issue tracking (Jira)
