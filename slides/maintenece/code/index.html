                Lynx is using Google Clousure Compiler in Advanced Optymalization mode.
                This give as static type checking, and mode code validation. We also introduce simple
                solution for class-like notation.

            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Lynx application on developers env can be runned in DEBUG mode where application is loaded
                from sources, this give as simle debbuging. In DEBUG mode also external libraries are loaded from
                source.

            <h2>documented</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                By using jsdoc we generating the documentation direcly form source code. JSDoc and Google Clousure Compiler
                is using the same annotations.

            <h2>well styled whit build time validation</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Lynx code is also validated by our own tool very similar to Java Checkstyle.

            <h2>testable whit simple coverage measure</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                For testing we are using the Karma test runner and Jasmine.
                Karma give as also coverage report generation.

            <h2>modularized and organized in namespaces</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                Lynx code is splited in to few modules, but we are also strongly using namespaces for well redable
                code organization. Durring compilation namespaces are removed, so there is no any overload from
                performance perspective.

            <h2>well understable by IDE, with autocomplete</h2>
            <div class="pointCommentary">
                During framework development we are using the JetBrains WebStorm IDE. Webstorm is well supporting the
                JsDoc/Clousure Compiler annotations. This give as autocompleition and code validation direct in
                IDE.
