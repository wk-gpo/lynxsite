        <h2>Reusability patterns</h2>
        <div class="desc">
			
			Reusability in Lynx happens at several levels - Lynx models and controllers, custom filters and directives,
			customized HTML templates. Lynx provides rich set of directives which extend standard HTML language. 
			This simplifies implementation of applications with complex layouts and speeds up development cycle. 
			Available filters let easily operate on data. Standard logic lets effectively manage application flow 
			directly from HTML code. Furthermore, Lynx enables provisioning of your own dedicated functional components. 
			At the same time, Lynx does not enforce use of its directives, filters, logic but easily integrates with other libraries.<br/>
