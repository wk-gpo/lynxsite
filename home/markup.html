            Throughout the development cycle, application's HTML remains the key artifact around which development
            work revolves. It allows easy integration of UX Web designer and application developer work. UX Web designer 
            creates and updates HTML templates while application developer decorates this HTML with bi-directional data 
            binding and enhanced HTML syntax to make it alive, to implement desired behaviors and application logic.
            Thanks to HTML based code, Live Application Editing is provided easily to stremline development process 
            even further. Just edit your HTML code in your preffered IDE and watch the results in browser instanteniously.
